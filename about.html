        <p>
          Hey! I'm Panashe Sanyanga, a Computer Science student who's really 
          excited about becoming a Software Engineer. I love building things 
          that solve real problems, especially in fintech and data visualization. 
          I'm always learning new things and working on projects that challenge me.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I like writing about what I learn and sharing 
          it with others. I think the best way to really understand something 
          is to try to explain it to someone else. Feel free to explore my work 
          and reach out if you want to chat!

              <h4>Project Overview</h4>
              <p>
                VaultComics was my university project and honestly, my first
                attempt at building something that looked like a real website.
                It's a comic book e-commerce site that I built to learn the
                basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Looking back, it's pretty
                basic, but it was where I started understanding how websites
                actually work.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="technical-details">
              <h4>What I Built</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Product Catalog:</strong> A grid of comic books with
                  images and prices
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Shopping Basket:</strong> Basic add-to-cart
                  functionality
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Checkout Process:</strong> Simple form to complete
                  purchases
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Made it work on different
                  screen sizes
                </li>

              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>Making JavaScript Actually Work</h5>
                <p>
                  I spent way too much time trying to get the shopping cart to
                  update properly. The concept of event listeners was completely
                  new to me, and I kept wondering why clicking buttons didn't do
                  anything. Eventually figured out that I needed to actually
                  tell JavaScript what to listen for.

              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>CSS Layouts</h5>
                <p>
                  Getting the product grid to look right was harder than I
                  expected. I didn't understand flexbox or grid at all, so I
                  used a lot of floats and positioning that probably wasn't the
                  best approach. But it worked!

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Debugging is Learning:</strong> Every error message
                  taught me something new
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Visual Design Matters:</strong> Making something look
                  good is as important as making it work
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Documentation Helps:</strong> Writing down what I was
                  trying to build kept me focused

              <h4>Project Overview</h4>
              <p>
                After completing VaultComics as my university project, I
                realized I needed to learn how to properly build a website from
                scratch. VaultComics was my first real website, but it was more
                of a learning exercise. This portfolio website represents my
                journey into understanding proper web development practices,
                JavaScript functionality, linking systems, and creating
                something that actually represents my skills professionally.

                <li>
                  <strong>Proper JavaScript:</strong> Moving beyond basic
                  scripts to actual interactive functionality

                <li>
                  <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Making sites that work on
                  phones, tablets, and desktops

              <h4>Real Challenges I Faced</h4>
              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>Understanding File Relationships</h5>
                <p>
                  Coming from VaultComics, I didn't really understand how HTML
                  files link to CSS and JavaScript. I kept breaking links and
                  wondering why styles weren't loading. I had to learn the
                  difference between relative and absolute paths, and how
                  browsers actually find and load resources.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>Making JavaScript Actually Work</h5>
                <p>
                  In VaultComics, my JavaScript was mostly copy-paste. Here, I
                  had to understand event listeners, DOM manipulation, and how
                  to make interactive elements that actually respond to user
                  actions. The contact form was particularly tricky - getting
                  form validation and submission working properly.

              </div>
              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>Professional Presentation</h5>
                <p>
                  This wasn't a university assignment anymore. I needed to
                  create something that potential employers would actually want
                  to look at. Learning about color schemes, typography, spacing,
                  and overall design principles became crucial.

              <h4>What This Taught Me</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Foundation Matters:</strong> Understanding the basics
                  of how web technologies work together is more important than
                  fancy features
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>User Experience:</strong> Building something that
                  works well for visitors is different from building something
                  that just works
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Professional Standards:</strong> There's a big
                  difference between student projects and professional work
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Debugging broken links and
                  JavaScript errors teaches you more than following tutorials
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Documentation:</strong> Keeping track of what you've

                Keep in Touch Chat is a real-time chat application I built to
                learn backend development and AI integration. It's a messaging
                platform where users can chat with each other, and there's an AI
                assistant that can help with conversations. This project taught
                me about databases, user authentication, and how to integrate
                external APIs.

              <h4>Biggest Challenges</h4>
              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>Understanding Backend Architecture</h5>
                <p>
                  Coming from frontend-only projects, learning how servers work
                  was completely new. I had to understand routes,
                  request/response cycles, and how data flows between frontend
                  and backend. Flask seemed overwhelming at first, but breaking
                  it down into smaller pieces helped.
                </p>

              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>Database Design and Queries</h5>
                <p>
                  Designing the database structure for users and messages was
                  tricky. I had to think about relationships between tables and
                  how to efficiently store and retrieve chat data. Writing SQL
                  queries that actually worked took a lot of trial and error.

                <h5>Real-time Updates Without WebSockets</h5>
                <p>
                  I wanted real-time chat but didn't know about WebSockets yet.
                  I used JavaScript intervals to poll the server for new
                  messages every few seconds. It's not the most elegant
                  solution, but it worked and taught me about client-server
                  communication.

              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>AI API Integration</h5>
                <p>
                  Integrating Google's Gemini API was my first time working with
                  external APIs. Understanding API keys, request formatting, and
                  error handling was a steep learning curve. The documentation
                  helped, but I still had to debug a lot of connection issues.

              <h4>Key Challenges & Solutions</h4>
              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>Portfolio P&L Not Updating</h5>
                <p>
                  The biggest challenge was ensuring real-time portfolio updates
                  reflected current market prices. I initially forgot to call
                  the `updatePositionsWithNewPrices()` function in the price
                  update loop. The solution involved carefully sequencing the
                  price updates with portfolio recalculations, ensuring that
                  every price change immediately reflected in user portfolios
                  and P&L calculations.

              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>Database Session Management</h5>
                <p>
                  SQLAlchemy session management proved tricky when updating user
                  balances and positions. I was trying to update detached
                  objects, which caused balance changes to not persist. The
                  solution was switching to direct update queries instead of
                  object manipulation, ensuring data consistency and proper
                  transaction handling.

              </div>
              <div class="challenge">
                <h5>Frontend-Backend Synchronization</h5>
                <p>
                  Ensuring the frontend displayed the most current data required
                  careful orchestration of API calls. Initially, transactions
                  weren't displaying because the frontend wasn't properly
                  fetching the `/transactions` endpoint in the correct sequence.
                  I implemented a proper fetch order that ensures portfolio
                  data, transactions, and current prices are all synchronized.

            <div class="lessons-learned">
              <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Backend Architecture:</strong> FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
                  provides powerful but complex backend capabilities that
                  require careful session management
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Real-time Systems:</strong> Real-time features need
                  careful sequencing and error handling to maintain data
                  consistency
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Database Design:</strong> Proper database modeling is
                  crucial for portfolio management and transaction tracking
                  systems
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Authentication Security:</strong> JWT + bcrypt
                  provides robust security, but proper token management is
                  essential
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>API Design:</strong> Well-structured APIs with proper
                  validation make frontend integration much smoother
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Database operations can break
                  easily with a single wrong query - comprehensive error
                  handling is vital
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Testing Approach:</strong> Manual testing of edge
                  cases revealed critical bugs that automated tests might miss
                </li>
